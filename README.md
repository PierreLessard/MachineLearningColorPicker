# MachineLearningColorPicker
Hello world machine learning project made while bored in the summer

file_creator.py is a turtle-app that lets you create training values for the model. 
If you run the script and then it will modify batch_data_color.txt and batch_data_rgb.txt adding more training items

model_trainer.py takes the batch_data_color.txt and batch_data_rgb and converts them to lists to train the model

model_tester.py is a similar program to file_creator.py but when the code is ran it shows the same box but the model responds to the colors instead

The program is not that impressive. I have yet to run accuracy tests, but I would gladly not trust this program 100% of the time.
I do believe, however, it is often correct more times then not
